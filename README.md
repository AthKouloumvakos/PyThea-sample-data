_PyThea_ is an open-source software package that can be used to reconstruct the 3D structure of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and shock waves and determine their kinematics using remote-sensing observations. The tool implements the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model that can be used to reconstruct CMEs and two geometrical models, namely a spheroid and ellipsoid model to reconstruct shock waves. It also implements remote-sensing observations from multiple viewpoints such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO).
